# python_brushing

This project is part of my effort to strengthen my understanding of Python programming fundamentals through hands-on practice. 

## Key Features:

- **Python Object and Data Structure Basics**: Understanding and working with different data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- **Comparison Operators**: Learning to use comparison operators to compare values and implement logical conditions.
- **Python Statements**: Using if-else statements, for loops, and while loops to control the flow of programs.
- **Methods and Functions**: Creating and using functions and methods to organize code and implement reusable components.

## Tic Tac Toe Game

As part of this project, I have implemented a Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game allows two players to play against each other, taking turns to place their markers ('X' or 'O') on the board. The game checks for a win or a tie after each move and announces the result.

### Features:

- **Clear Board Display**: The game board is displayed clearly after each move.
- **Player Input**: Players are prompted to choose their marker ('X' or 'O') and enter their desired position on the board.
- **Win/Tie Check**: The game checks for a winning combination or a tie after each move.
- **Replay Option**: Players have the option to play again after the game ends.

### How to Play:

1. Run the script to start the game.
2. Player 1 chooses their marker ('X' or 'O'). Player 2 automatically gets the other marker.
3. Players take turns to enter a position (1-9) to place their marker on the board.
4. The game announces the winner or if it's a tie.
5. Players can choose to play again or exit the game.
